## Project Status

The CardDemo application has been enhanced with optional features that extend its functionality:
- Credit Card Authorizations with IMS, DB2, and MQ
- Transaction Type Management with DB2
- Account Extractions using MQ and VSAM
- Additional JCL Utilities
- Enhanced Data and Copybook Features

These optional features make CardDemo an even more useful resource for customers looking to modernize their mainframe applications. With modules for DB2, MQ, IMS DB, JCL utilities, and more data formats now available, customers can leverage CardDemo to test a wider array of mainframe migration, refactoring, replatforming, and augmentation scenarios.
